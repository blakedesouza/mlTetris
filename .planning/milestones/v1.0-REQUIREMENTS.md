# Requirements: ML Tetris Trainer

**Defined:** 2025-01-19
**Core Value:** Watch an AI visibly improve at Tetris with full control over training and model management

## v1 Requirements

### Environment

- [x] **ENV-01**: Tetris game engine with standard rules (SRS rotation, 7-bag randomizer)
- [x] **ENV-02**: Feature-based state representation (column heights, holes, bumpiness)
- [x] **ENV-03**: Meta-action space (agent selects final piece placement, not primitive moves)
- [x] **ENV-04**: Shaped reward function (penalties for holes/height, bonus for lines cleared)
- [x] **ENV-05**: Gymnasium-compatible interface for RL integration

### Training

- [x] **TRAIN-01**: DQN agent with experience replay buffer
- [x] **TRAIN-02**: Start training from web UI
- [x] **TRAIN-03**: Stop training from web UI
- [x] **TRAIN-04**: Configurable goal (target number of lines to clear)
- [x] **TRAIN-05**: Progress display (episode count, current score, lines cleared)
- [x] **TRAIN-06**: Real-time reward/score chart updating during training
- [x] **TRAIN-07**: Headless mode for fast training (no visualization overhead)
- [x] **TRAIN-08**: Visual mode for watching AI play in real-time
- [x] **TRAIN-09**: Toggle between headless and visual modes without interrupting training
- [x] **TRAIN-10**: Pause training mid-session
- [x] **TRAIN-11**: Resume training from paused state
- [x] **TRAIN-12**: Training speed control (adjust game speed during visual mode)

### Visualization

- [x] **VIS-01**: Web-based interface accessible via browser
- [x] **VIS-02**: Live game board showing current Tetris state
- [x] **VIS-03**: Training status indicator (running/paused/stopped)
- [x] **VIS-04**: Split view layout (game board + metrics side by side)
- [x] **VIS-05**: Demo mode to watch trained models play without training

### Model Management

- [x] **MODEL-01**: Save model checkpoint to file
- [x] **MODEL-02**: Load model checkpoint from file
- [x] **MODEL-03**: Resume training from saved checkpoint (preserves full state)
- [x] **MODEL-04**: Multiple model slots (store different model versions)
- [x] **MODEL-05**: Model comparison view (leaderboard showing performance metrics)
- [x] **MODEL-06**: Export best model to standalone file
- [x] **MODEL-07**: Auto-save best model when new high score achieved

## v2 Requirements (Deferred)

### Advanced Training

- **TRAIN-ADV-01**: Multiple algorithm support (PPO, A2C in addition to DQN)
- **TRAIN-ADV-02**: Hyperparameter tuning interface
- **TRAIN-ADV-03**: Training session history with replay

### Advanced Visualization

- **VIS-ADV-01**: Multiple simultaneous game views (watch several AIs at once)
- **VIS-ADV-02**: Side-by-side model comparison (two models playing simultaneously)
- **VIS-ADV-03**: Desktop GUI option (pygame or tkinter alternative to web)

### Advanced Model Management

- **MODEL-ADV-01**: Model versioning with git-like history
- **MODEL-ADV-02**: Model annotations and notes
- **MODEL-ADV-03**: Import/export model bundles with metadata

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Multiplayer/competitive modes | Single AI training focus for v1 |
| Custom Tetris piece shapes | Standard 7 tetrominoes sufficient |
| Cloud deployment | Local-first for v1, reduces complexity |
| Mobile app | Web interface accessible on any device |
| Real-time hyperparameter modification | Complex to implement, defer to v2 |
| Distributed training | Single-machine sufficient for Tetris scale |
| Custom reward function editor | Predefined shaped rewards work well |
| OAuth/user accounts | Single-user local application |
