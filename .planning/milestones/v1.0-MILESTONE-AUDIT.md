## Anti-Patterns

No anti-patterns found across all phases:
- No TODO/FIXME comments in production code
- No placeholder implementations
- No empty returns or stubs
- No orphaned exports

## Tech Debt

None identified. All phases completed to specification.

## Human Verification Notes

Phase 4 and 5 have manual UI verification requirements:
- Pause/resume visual feedback
- Visual mode toggle showing board updates
- Speed slider affecting animation timing
- Demo mode playback observation
- Table sorting and slot management UI

These were verified during phase execution per SUMMARY.md files.

## Conclusion

**v1 Milestone PASSED.** The ML Tetris Trainer is feature-complete for v1:

1. **Environment:** Gymnasium-compatible Tetris with feature-based observations and shaped rewards
2. **Training:** DQN agent with full checkpoint support (save/load/resume)
3. **Web Dashboard:** Live board visualization, metrics charts, start/stop controls
4. **Training Controls:** Pause/resume, headless/visual toggle, speed adjustment
5. **Model Management:** Multiple slots, comparison leaderboard, demo mode, export

Ready for `/gsd:complete-milestone` to archive and tag.
