<objective>
Create comprehensive test suite and verify Phase 2 success criteria with end-to-end training tests.

Purpose: Validate that DQN training works, checkpoints preserve full state, and trained agent shows improvement over random baseline (the core success criteria for Phase 2).

Output: Test suite covering TRAIN-01, TRAIN-04, TRAIN-07, MODEL-01, MODEL-02, MODEL-03 requirements.

Create tests for checkpoint functionality and end-to-end training.

- test_load_checkpoint_restores_timesteps: loaded agent has correct timesteps_trained
- test_load_checkpoint_restores_config: loaded agent has original config values
- test_resume_training_continues: train() after load continues from saved state
- test_replay_buffer_preserved: replay buffer has entries after load (not empty)

tests/training/test_training.py (TRAIN-01, TRAIN-04, TRAIN-07):
- test_train_headless_runs: train_headless completes without error
- test_train_headless_creates_checkpoint: checkpoint dir has files after training
- test_train_headless_resumes: second call to train_headless resumes from checkpoint
- test_goal_callback_stops_training: Training stops early when target_lines reached (mock or very low target)

Run full test suite to verify all Phase 2 requirements are met.

1. Run all tests:
```bash
pytest tests/ -v --tb=short
```

2. Verify requirement coverage:
- TRAIN-01 (DQN with replay): test_agent_has_model, test_replay_buffer_preserved
- TRAIN-04 (configurable goal): test_goal_callback_stops_training
- TRAIN-07 (headless): test_train_headless_runs
- MODEL-01 (save checkpoint): test_save_checkpoint_creates_files
- MODEL-02 (load checkpoint): test_load_checkpoint_restores_agent
- MODEL-03 (resume training): test_resume_training_continues

3. Quick manual verification (run in terminal):
```python
from src.training import train_headless, TrainingConfig
import tempfile

# Short training to verify everything works
with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmpdir:
    config = TrainingConfig(max_timesteps=1000, learning_starts=100)
